**Assignment 7**
**1. If I were to create a stored program to delete a customer from the database it would be a stored procedure.
In order to delete the customer I would first indicate the database that I would like to use, next I would write a statement to drop the procedure I was going to create just in case there is a procedure that exists with the name.
Next I would add a delimiter so the procedure executes properly and write a create statement and the name of the new procedure.
Next I would list the values (columns) needed to be deleted that is associated with the customer data.
Next I will begin the procedure with an if statement, if a certain condition is met, delete from the customer table where the customer ID matches that of the id that is being requested to be deleted.
Finally I will end the procedure and test the procedure with a statment.**
